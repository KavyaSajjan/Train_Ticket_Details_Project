#Coding Assessment

To fulfill the requirements and implement the project using Java Spring Boot, Postman for API 
testing, and MySQL for databases, you'll need to follow several steps. Below is an outline of how you can approach this task:

#Environment setup
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Maven.
Set up MySQL and create a database for the project.
Install and configure Spring Boot.

#Springboot
Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies 
such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.

#MySQL 
Update application.properties with MySQL database connection details.
Configure Hibernate dialect and other properties.

#Postman
Use Postman to test the implemented APIs.
Verify that the endpoints behave as expected and handle various scenarios.
